# Link handler for Sailfish apps

This module provides a link handler to open or copy external links.

Text items and Silica's `Label` support external links using the
`<a href="url">title</a>` notation. They can then be opened externally when
clicked by a user.

To avoid surprises, it is often desirable to give users the option to copy an
external link instead of immediately opening it in the default web browser.
This module provides a way to do that.


## Usage

Simply define a QML label and set its link handler to the one provided by this
module.

```{qml}
import QtQuick 2.0
import Sailfish.Silica 1.0
import Opal.LinkHandler 1.0

Label {
    text: 'This is my text, and <a href="https://example.org">this is my link</a>.'
    color: Theme.highlightColor
    linkColor: Theme.primaryColor  // important, as the default color is plain blue
    onLinkActivated: LinkHandler.openOrCopyUrl(link)
}
```

## Screenshots

Screenshots can be found in the [doc](doc/) directory.

## Translations

To **use** packaged translations in your project, follow the main documentation for
using Opal modules [here](https://github.com/Pretty-SFOS/opal#using-opal).

You can also **contribute** translations. If an app uses Opal modules, consider
updating its translations at the source (i.e. here), so that all Opal users can
benefit from it. Translations are managed using
[Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/opal).

Please prefer Weblate over pull requests (which are still welcome, of course).
If you just found a minor problem, you can also
[leave a comment in the forum](https://forum.sailfishos.org/t/opal-qml-components-for-app-development/15801)
or [open an issue](https://github.com/Pretty-SFOS/opal/issues/new).

Please include the following details:

1. the language you were using
2. where you found the error
3. the incorrect text
4. the correct translation

See [the Qt documentation](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qtqml-date.html#details) for
details on how to translate date formats to your local format.
